# RAC---The-Radio-Alarm-Clock ->> Open Source Project

this project is released as Open Software/ Open Hardware. All the documentation you need to build it is provided free and without any warranty.
You may modify, improve, distribute as long as you give proper credit.

I made video series with the full build tutorial, so you can see how I designed it, how everything works, the assemby and finally the testing of this device.
Here's the link for Part 1 of this series: https://youtu.be/nwrcHMGG3TY

There's gonna be a second version of the PCB, for SMD components only. I'll upload it here as soon as I polish the details.
